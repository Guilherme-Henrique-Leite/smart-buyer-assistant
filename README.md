## Project Overview

This project builds a recommendation system for e-commerce applications. It analyzes user-product interaction data (e.g., ratings, purchases) to recommend products that are likely to be of interest to the user. The main techniques used are:

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends products based on similar users or similar products.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the dataset for analysis.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Precision.
